# Automating NCHS formatting standards for PowerPoint outputs in Quarto and Rmd

**Goal:** Automate formatting of NCHS graphs, tables, and PowerPoint slides by pre-loading templates and color schemes into RStudio for compatibility with Quarto

**Notes:**
+ Error message still persists on rendering, though files do render correctly - needs resolution
+ Template had to be hand-created for Quarto compatibility

**Examples posted:**
+ rdc-proposals-report.docx - Rendered Word doc with color schemes, formatting etc.
+ rdc-proposals.pdf - Pdf version of PowerPoint slide outputs
